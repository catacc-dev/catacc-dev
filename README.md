<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Catarina 👩🏻</h1>



🎓 I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in **Biomedical Engineering** from the University of Coimbra. My master's degree was specialised in *Clinical Informatics and Bioinformatics*, but in recent years I've developed a deep curiosity and interest in exploring useful solutions through **machine learning** to make **healthcare** **more** **personalised**.

🌱 I’m currently learning **French** and exploring the functioning of **LLMs**. 

⚡ Fun fact: I am from the "Pearl of the Atlantic", Madeira Island (Portugal).

🏆 Career goal: Build an international career while working on meaningful, energising projects at the intersection of AI and healthcare

🚀 I'm currently seeking opportunities in medtech companies/startups, where I can gain hands-on experience in this field and contribute to impactful projects through innovative solutions.
